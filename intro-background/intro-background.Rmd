# Text as Data

- Text Data for Social Scientists:

  - open ended survey responses, social media data, interview transcripts, electronic health records, news articles, official documents (laws, regulations, etc.), research publications, digital trace data

- even if data of interest does not exist in textual form (yet): tools of speech recognition and machine translation, crowdworkers, etc.

- *previously*: text data was often ignored, selectively read and used anecdotally or manually labeled
 
- *now*: wide variety of text analytical methods (supervised + unsupervised) and increasing adoption of these methods from social scientists

# Language in NLP

.gold[corpus]: a collection of documents

.gold[documents]: single tweets, single statements, single text files, etc.

.gold[tokenization]: refers to defining the unit of analysis, e.g., single words, sequences of words or entire sentences (referred to as .gold[tokens])

.gold[bag of words (method)]: approach where all tokens are put together in a “bag” without considering their order (alternatively: .gold[bigrams (word pairs), word embeddings]) 
- possible issues with a simple bag-of-word: “I’m not *happy* and I don’t *like* it!”
  
.gold[stop words]: very common but uninformative terms such as “the”, “and”, “they”, etc.

.gold[document-term/feature matrix (DTM/DFM)]: common format to store text data (more later on)

# A typical (R-) Workflow for Text Analysis

1. Retrieve data / data collection

2. Data manipulation / Corpus pre-processing

3. Vectorization (DTM/DFM)

4. Analysis

5. Validation and Model Selection

6. Visualization and Model Interpretation

---
# 1. Data collection

- use existing corpora 
  - R: {gutenbergr}: contains more than 60k book transcripts 
  - R: {quanteda.corpora}: [multiple inherit corpora](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda.corpora)
  - R: {topicmodels}: contains Associated Press data (2246 news articles mostly from around 1988)
  - search for datasets, see e.g. [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7cvuCBQxosQK2evTcdL3qtglaEPc0WFEs6rZMx-xiE/edit#gid=0)
  
- collect new corpora
  - electronic sources (APIs, Web Scraping), e.g. Twitter, Wikipedia, [transcripts of all german electoral programs](https://www.bundestagswahl-2021.de/wahlprogramme/)
  - undigitized text, e.g. scans of documents
  - data from  interviews, surveys and/or experiments

- consider relevant applications to turn your data into text format (speech-to-text recognition ([google API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text)), [pdf-to-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext), [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition#:~:text=Optical%20character%20recognition%20or%20optical,billboards%20in%20a%20landscape%20photo)))

---
# 2. Data manipulation

- text data is different from “structured” data (e.g., a set of rows and columns)

- most often not “clean” but rather messy
  - shortcuts, dialect, wrong grammar, missing words, spelling issues, ambiguous language, humor
  - web context: emoticons, #, etc.

- Investing some time in carefully cleaning and preparing your data might be one of the most crucial determinants for a successful text analysis!

---
# 2. Data manipulation

Common steps in pre-processing text data:
  - stemming
    - computation, computational, computer $\rightarrow$ compute
  - lemmatization
    - "good" $\rightarrow$ "better"
  - transformation to lower cases
  - removal of punctuation (,;.-) / numbers / white spaces / URLs / stopwords

$\rightarrow$ Always choose your prepping steps carefully! 

For instance removing punctuation might be a good idea in almost all projects, however think of unhappy cases: “Let’s eat, Grandpa” vs. “Lets eat Grandpa.”
- unit of analysis! (sentence vs. unigram)

---
# 2. Data manipulation

- In principle, all those transformations can be achieved by using base R

- Other packages however provide ready-to-apply functions, such as [{tidytext}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html), [{tm}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html), [{quanteda}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quanteda/index.html) 
  - each with its own advantages and shortcomings (examples on the next slides)

- **Important**: to start pre-processing with this packages your data always has to be first transformed to a **corpus object** or alternatively to a **tidy text object** (*examples on the next slides*)

---
# 2. Data manipulation: tidytext Example

Pre-processing with {tidytext} requires a tidy text object:
  - one-token-per-row
  - “long format"

```{r}
library(quanteda)
library(quanteda.corpora)
library(dplyr)
```

First have a look at the original data ([collection of guardian articles](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda.corpora), n=20):

```{r, results="raw"}
guardian_corpus <- quanteda.corpora::download("data_corpus_guardian")

text <- guardian_corpus[["documents"]][["texts"]]
df <- as.data.frame(text)

text <- df[1:20,]
df <- as.data.frame(text)
df <- tibble::rowid_to_column(df, "ID")

str(df,5)
dim(df)
```

.gold[Q: Can you describe the above dataset? How many variables and observations are there? What do the variables display?]

---
# 2. Data manipulation: tidytext Example

<font size="4"> - by using the unnest_tokens() function we transform the original data to a tidy text format

.gold[Q: How does our dataset change after tokenization and removing stopwords? How many observations do we now have? And what does the ID variable identify/store?]


```{r, echo=TRUE, results="raw"}
# Load the tidytext package
library(tidytext)

# Create tidy text format and remove stopwords
tidy_df <- df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) 

str(tidy_df,5)
dim(tidy_df)
```
</font size>

---
# 2. Data manipulation: tidytext Example

+: tidytext removes punctuation and makes all words lowercase automatically

-: all other transformations need some dealing with [regular expressions](https://cbail.github.io/SICSS_Basic_Text_Analysis.html) (gsub, grep, etc.) $\rightarrow$ consider alternative packages (examples on the next slides)

  - Example to remove white space with tidytext (s+ describes a blank space)

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
tidy_df$word <- gsub("\\s+","",tidy_df$word)
```

+: with the tidy text format, regular R functions can be used instead of the specialized functions necessary to analyze a corpus object

  - dplyr example to count the most popular words in your texts
  
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
tidy_df %>% count(word) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```
  
---
# 2. Data manipulation: tm Example

- Input data is not a tidy text object but a corpus object
  - corpus in R: group of documents with associated metadata
  
```{r, echo=T, results="raw"}
# Load the tm package
library(tm)

# Create a corpus
corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(df$text))
corpus
```

```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("corpus_1_tm.PNG")
```
---
# 2. Data manipulation: tm Example

- tm_map() functions can be applied to a whole corpus

```{r, echo=T, results="raw"}
# Clean corpus
corpus_clean <- corpus %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation, preserve_intra_word_dashes = TRUE) %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>% 
  tm_map(content_transformer(tolower)) %>% 
  tm_map(removeWords, words = c(stopwords("en"))) %>% 
  tm_map(stripWhitespace) %>% 
  tm_map(stemDocument)
```

```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("corpus_2_tm.PNG")
```

---
# 2. Data manipulation: quanteda Example

- Input data again is a corpus object

```{r, echo=T}
# Load quanteda package
library(quanteda)

# Store data in a corpus object
corpus <- corpus(df$text)
```

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("corpus_1_quanteda.PNG")
```

---
# 2. Data manipulation: quanteda Example

- quanteda combines prepping and dfm-transformation in one step (see next slides on vectorization for more information)

```{r, echo=T}
dfm <- dfm(corpus,
            stem = TRUE,
            tolower = TRUE,
            remove_twitter = FALSE,
            remove_punct = TRUE,
            remove_url = FALSE,
            remove_numbers =TRUE,
            verbose = TRUE,
            remove = stopwords('english'))
```

```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("corpus_2_quanteda.PNG")
```
---
# 2. Data manipulation: Summary

- R (as usual) offers many ways to achieve similar or same results

- To start with, I would choose one package you feel comfortable with and go with it.. you will soon get a grasp for your data (and textual data in general) with advantages and disadvantages of different packages :-)

---

# 3. Vectorization: Turning Text into a Matrix

- Text analytical models (e.g., topic models) often require certain your data to be stored in a special format
  - only so will algorithms be able to quickly compare one document to a lot of other documents to identify patterns

- Typically: **document-term matrix (DTM)**, sometimes also called **document-feature matrix (DFM)**
  - matrix with each row being a document and each word being a column
    - term-frequency (tf): The number within each cell describes the number of times the word appears in the document
    - term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf): weights the occurence of certain words, e.g., lowering the weight of the word “social” in an corpus of sociological articles
    
???

td-idf: how often a word appears in a local context (such as a document) with how much it appears overall in the document collection

---
# 3. Vectorization: tidytext example

<font size="3">Remember our tidy text formatted data (one-token-per-row)?

```{r, out.width = "10%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("tidytext_1.PNG")
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
# Cast tidy text data into DTM format
dtm <- tidy_df %>% 
  count(ID,word) %>%
  cast_dtm(document=ID,
                 term=word,
                 value=n) %>%
        as.matrix()
dim(dtm)
```

```{r, out.width = "40%", fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("tidytext_2.PNG")
```
</font size>

---
# 3. Vectorization: tm example

<font size="4">
- In case you pre-processed your data with {tm}, remember we ended with a cleaned corpus object
- Now, simply put your corpus object into the DocumentTermMatrix function of the tm-package  

```{r, echo=T, out.width="50%"}
dtm_tm <- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus_clean, control = list(wordLengths = c(2, Inf))) # control argument here is specified to include words that are at least two characters long

inspect(dtm_tm[1:3,3:8])
```

- for quanteda example: look at the previous slide with the quanteda example ;-)

# 4. Analysis: Topic Models

<font size="4">Aim: 
- discovering the hidden (i.e, latent) topics within the documents and assigning each of the topics to the documents
- topic modeling: entirely unsupervised classification
  - $\rightarrow$ no prior knowledge of your corpus or possible latent topics is needed (however some knowledge might help you validate your model later on) 
- Researcher only needs to specify number of topics (not as intuitive as it sounds!)</font size>

# 4. Analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

- one of the most popular topic model algorithms
- developed by a team of computer linguists (David Blei, Andrew Ng und Michael Jordan, [original paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf)) 

- two assumptions:

  - 1) each document is a mixture over latent topics
      - For example, in a two-topic model we could say “Document 1 is 90% topic A and 10% topic B, while Document 2 is 30% topic A and 70% topic B.”
      
  - 2) each topic is a mixture of words (with possible overlap)

# 4. Analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation

<font size="4.5">
1) specify number of topics (*k*)

2) each word (*w*) in each document (*d*) is randomly assigned to one topic (assignment involves a [Dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution)) 
  
3) these topic assignments for each word *w* are then updated in an iterative fashion ([Gibbs Sampler](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/topic-modeling-using-lda-and-gibbs-sampling-explained-49d49b3d1045)) 
  - namely: again, for each word in each document two probabilities are repeatedly calculated:
    - a) “document”-level: proportion of words in document *d* belonging to a certain topic *t* (beta) -> relative importance of topics in documents
    - b) “word”-level: proportion of words being assigned to a certain topic *t* in all other documents (gamma) -> relative importance of words in topics
  - each word is reassigned to a new topic which is chosen as the probability of *p = beta x gamma* (-> overall probability that a certian topic generated the respective word *w*, put differently: overall probability that that *w* belongs to topic 1, 2, 3 or 4 (if *k* was set to 4)

4) Assignment stops after user-specified threshold,	or when iterations begin to have little impact on	the probabilities	assigned to words in	the corpus</font size> 

---
# 4. Analysis: Structural Topic Models

- Structural Topic Models (STM) employs main ideas of LDA but adds a couple more features on top^
  - e.g., STM recognizes if topics might be related to one another (e.g., if document 1 contains topic *A* it might be very likely that it also contains topic *B*, but not topic *C* - Correlated Topic Model) 
  
- especially useful for social scientists who are interested in modeling effects of covariates (e.g., year, author, sociodemographics, time as a covariate, source)

- generally, by allowing to include such metadata STM exceeds a simple bag-of-words approach

.footnote[<font size="3"><br>^for an detailed explanation of differences between LDA and STM, read [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-the-structural-topic-model-stm-34ec4bd5383#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20interested%20in,a%20couple%20different%20algorithms%20(the)]
